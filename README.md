# Sympto Coding Challenge

You are going to build a small part of the EMR billing system from scratch. Specifically, this project asks you to design a simple web app that allows doctors to:

• Maintains a list of patients, and their appointments.

• User is allowed to (1) select a list of services, each with its own set cost, that were used in the patient appointment. (2) See a total bill at the bottom with the sum of all services selected.
